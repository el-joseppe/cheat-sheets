# Obsidian
Obsidian is a nice tool for note-keeping. I personally haven't used it much, and only recently started using it more since I got very frustrated with keeping my work-related notes and documentations in Notepad ðŸ˜œ
And since I already planned to do this cheat-sheet-repo i figured that this would be a nice opportunity to finally try out Obsidian. 
I like the clean look, that it is based on markdown, that it is free and open source and that I can sync each obsidian-vault to whatever public or private git-repo that I want. So it checks a lot of boxes for me.
