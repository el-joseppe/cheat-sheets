# How to de-google
Google is the goto provider for many people's personal productivity system. Google is easy to sign up and its cloud services like mail, drive, docs, spreadsheets, keep, maps, photos, oauth-service, chrome, bookmarks, passwords, pay-service, youtube, adsense, analytics, .... (the list goes on) and even its search-function are easy to use, highly available, have world-class features and most importantly can be used **for free** (at least you don't need to pay for it with money). 

But all the convenience Google provides has also it's con's and downside's as well. And in my estimation those are only getting bigger. 

Here I want to give a quick overview of the reasons why one would choose to avoid using one of google's services and more importantly, what options are out there to replace those services with an emphasis on self-hostable options. 

## Why to de-google
Because of reasons ... I have to put a bit more thought into this!

## How to actually do it?
Well that's the real elephant in the room, isn't it? Especially if one is already deeply invested in google's services, there are plenty of question marks how one can maintain an acceptable level of convenience, usability, availability, look and feel and price with the alternatives that are out there. There are many reasons that make google's services great, but these stand out at least for me:
- Web-based - all of google's services I use are accessible via browser
- mobile-friendly - all of google's services I use are accessible via native mobile-apps 
- fast - all of google's services I use are accessible whenever I need them and I never had a problem with there performance or reaction time

Those 3 points are allready tough enough to find an equal replacement. There are easier cases like passwords ore browsers mostly due to the fact that great alternatives are available, that are as good or in some cases even better than their google-counterpart. But in other cases like Mail, Photos or Drive good alternatives are either costly or require a lot of tech-skills or simply don't exist.
